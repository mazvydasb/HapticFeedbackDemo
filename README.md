# HapticFeedbackDemo
Simple app to demo the UIFeedbackGenerator and Haptic Feedback possibilities on iPhone 6s.

To be able to try it you need an iPhone 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus or newer. Trying the UIFeedbackGenerator API on older devices or on the simluator will do nothing. However, there's a work-around that allows Haptic Feedback use on iPhone 6s and 6s Plus via AudioToolbox.
